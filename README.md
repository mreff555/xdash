# xdash
This project is very much WIP.  The inspiration came from having conflicting preferences of beautiful MacOS GUI's and my love for simple fast and functional linux window managers.  The goal is a application and desktop switching dashboard that is beautiful while still being minimal and functional.

## Done
- Basic class stubbed out with makefile.  Compiles and creates an overlay window which hangs around for 10 seconds.

## TODO
